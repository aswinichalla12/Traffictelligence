## 📌 Key Features

- 📹 Analyzes traffic video/image data
- 🧠 Applies ML models to predict traffic volume
- ⏱ Real-time or batch traffic estimation
- 📊 Dashboard integration for visualization (optional)
- 🛣 Supports scalable deployment for smart cities

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- *Python* 🐍
- *OpenCV* for video/image processing
- *Scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow* (any ML library used)
- *Pandas, NumPy* for data handling
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn* for visualization
- *Flask* for web integration (optional)
- *Jupyter Notebooks* for development and experimentation
